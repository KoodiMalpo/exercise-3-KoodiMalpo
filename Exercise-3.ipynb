    "# Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 3 includes five problems (+ 1 optional) that you need to solve with **programming**. For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own solutions. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub regularly! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case anything happen with your computer.\n",
    " \n",
    "An overview of the tasks (total 20 points):\n",
    "\n",
    " - Problem 1: get familiar with CSC Noppe cloud computing environment and working with Git (version control)\n",
    " - Problem 2: read data into geopandas from different file formats and make maps out of the data\n",
    " - Problem 3: geocode addresses from Excel file(s)\n",
    " - Problem 4: create a routable network for car\n",
    " - Problem 5: conduct shortest path analysis along road network\n",
    " - *(Problem 6: Optional: conduct shortest path analysis between multiple locations.)*\n",
    " - Problem 7: give us an estimate about how much time you used for doing the exercise and optional feedback about it\n",
    " \n",
    "### Time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is the first time, this exercise is given, we do not yet have an accurate estimate of the workload. However, we estimate that it takes over 10 hours to finish this Exercise. The time it takes can vary significantly from student to student, so we recommended that you start immediately working on the exercise to avoid issues meeting with the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due date\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit (push) your Exercise answers to your personal Github repository **by Friday 15th November 23:59**. \n",
    "      \n",
    "### Start your exercise in CSC Noppe\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start programming, you need to launch the CSC Notebook instance and clone your **personal copy of the Exercise repository** (i.e. something like `exercise-3-htenkanen`) there using Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are documents that can be used and run inside the JupyterLab programming environment (e.g. at [noppe.csc.fi](https://noppe.csc.fi/)) containing the computer code and rich text elements (such as text, figures, tables and links). \n",
    "\n",
    "**A couple of hints**:\n",

    "- You can **execute a cell** by clicking a given cell that you want to run and pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or by clicking the \"Play\" button on top)\n",
    "- You can **change the cell-type** between `Markdown` (for writing text) and `Code` (for writing/executing code) from the dropdown menu above. \n",
